As part of the API Integration and Data Visualization domain at CODTECH IT SOLUTION, I developed a Python script that fetches live weather forecast data using the requests library and OpenWeatherMap API.The data is parsed using the built-in json() method, and key information such as temperature and timestamps is printed using print() for debugging and verification. For visual representation, the matplotlib.pyplot library is used to plot a temperature trend graph over time, with plt.plot() and plt.show() rendering the final chart. This project was executed using tools such as Google Colab and VS Code to ensure both text and graphical outputs are correctly displayed.
